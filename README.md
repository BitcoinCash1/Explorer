Bitcoin Cash Explorer created by Melroy van den Berg, focused on mempool as well as block explorer.

## Developers

For more details, please read the [BCH-SETUP.md](BCH-SETUP.md) file.

## Advanced Installation Methods

BCH Explorer can be installed in other ways too, but we only recommend doing so if you're a developer, have experience managing servers, or otherwise know what you're doing.

- See the [`docker/`](./docker/) directory for instructions on deploying Mempool with Docker.
- See the [`backend/`](./backend/) and [`frontend/`](./frontend/) directories for manual install instructions oriented for developers.
- See the [`production/`](./production/) directory for guidance on setting up a more serious Mempool instance designed for high performance at scale.
